\begin{exercises}{sec:0205p}

\lab{} The average rate of change of any function is simply the change in outputs, divided by the change in inputs.  For any function $f(x)$, write an algebraic fraction for the average rate of change from an input of $c$ to an input of $d$.

\vspace{3cm}
\lab{} Next, suppose we want to find the average rate of change near point $c$.  Write out --- in correct notation --- ``the limit as $x$ approaches $c$ of the average rate of change of $f(x)$ from $x$ to $c$.''

\lab{} Coming out of the abstract, let us find the rate of change of a physical object, say a thrown ball.  A mathematical model for this situation might be $f(x)=-x^2+4x+5$.  Begin by graphing the function in the first quadrant:

\noindent
\begin{tikzpicture}[xscale=0.65,yscale=0.65]
	\draw [thick, ->] (-0.3,0) -- (10.3,0);
	\draw [thick, ->] (0,-0.3) -- (0,10.3);
	\draw [thin] (0,0) grid (10,10);
\end{tikzpicture}

\lab{}  If we try to calculate directly the average rate of change at 0, we get an indeterminate form.  Write the limit and solve it, for $x$ approaching 0 of the average rate of change of $f(x)$, from $x$ to 0.


\vspace{3cm}
\lab{} Looking at the graph, what do you estimate the rate of change is at $x=2$?  Now, use limits to find the exact answer.


\vspace{3cm}
\lab{}   When we are able to construct a function that outputs the rate of change, it is said to be the derivative function of the original.  Try to find the derivative of $f(x)$ by moving some distance $h$ to the right of $x$, setting up the average rate of change and taking the limit at $h$ approaches zero.
