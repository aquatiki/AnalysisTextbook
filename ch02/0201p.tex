\subsection{Removing the Hole}
\noindent
1. For most of the problems we will encounter in this class, there will be some ``problem spot''
$c$ in their domain, where the function is undefined.  Typically, if we try to evaluate $f(c)$,
we will get $\frac{0}{0}$, what is called an \gls{indeterminate form}.  For example, try plugging
in 0 for $x$:

$$
f(x)=\frac{x}{(x+3)^3-27}
$$
\noindent

\vspace{1cm}

2. The solution (in this case) is to \emph{expand} the cubing term and let the 27's cancel.  
Work out the algebra, and show that the result
is $\frac{1}{27}$.

\vspace{2cm}

\noindent
3. A second technique is our old stand-by, \emph{factoring}.  Show that direct evaluation of this
function at 5 yields an indeterminate form:

$$
m(c) = \frac{c^2-c-20}{c-5}
$$

\vspace{1cm}
\noindent
4.  Now factor the numerator, cancel the common term and show that the result equals 9.

\vspace{2cm}

\noindent
5. Thirdly, there is the more laborious problem of \emph{removing compound fractions}.  Again,
first show that $\frac{0}{0}$ zero results, in this case at 2:

$$
s(t)=\cfrac{t-2}{\frac{1}{t}-\frac{1}{2}}
$$

\vspace{1cm}

\noindent
6.  Next, get a common denominator in the denominator and then recall that division is the 
same as multiplying by the reciprocal.  Show that
the result is -4.

\vspace{2cm}

\noindent
7. Finally, there is a trickiest trick of all: the conjugate.  A very common technique in higher maths
is to recast a binomial by somehow multiplying by its \textbf{conjugate}.  \index{conjugate}
The conjugate of any
binomial $a+b$ is $a-b$, and the same is true in reverse.  What is the conjugate of the following
functions numerator?

$$
g(y) = \frac{\sqrt{y}-3}{y-9}
$$

\vspace{1cm}

\noindent
8.  Do we need this trick?  What happens to the function at 9?

\vspace{1cm}

\noindent
9. Since we are not resolving an equation, but an expression, the only why to multiply by the 
conjugate of the numerator of $g(y)$ it to do it to the numerator and the denominator.  However,
do not distribute $\sqrt{y}+3$ in the denominator, but leave it separate.  Show that result is
$\frac{1}{6}$.

\vspace{2cm}

\noindent
10.  In every case, we made a modified version of the original function through algebra manipulation.
This new version is nearly identical but lacks the \textbf{removable discontinuity} of the original.
Describe in your own words how our changes effect the domain.
