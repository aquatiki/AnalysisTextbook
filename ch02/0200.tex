%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Limits are a way of expressing what a function's output approaches as the input gets
closer and closer to a given value.  In this section, we will use limits to describe the 
location of ``holes'' in graphs, continuous functions, asymptotes and sided-limits, 
the difference quotient and derivatives.

Sound engineers use advanced functions to design waveforms that would not occur in nature.
The distinctive sound of much of today's electronic music comes from computer approximating
what infinite sums of sounds waves would sound like.  Are there actual infinities in the physical
universe?  If something cannot exist without human creativity, what does that mean about its
place in the world, its ``rightness'' or ``wrongness''?

How should we treat our responses to questions where we cannot verify our answers?
Should we only interpolate, or is extrapolation also valid?  Is it reasonable to assume
things continue after the manner we have observed when they are unobserved, or even
unobservable?  Is anything in our universe able to be modeled with only one function across
all of its domain? What good is it to instantaneous change, when change -- by definition --
happens over time?

\section{Review}
\subsection{Chapter Review}
This chapter was generally new ideas, that we might describe where a function ``would've gone'',
whether it ended up with a value or not.  This idea --- called a limit --- has a formal definition with
the Greek letters $\epsilon$ and $\delta$, which correspond to the ``error'' in the $y$ values
resulting ``differences'' in the $x$/input.  Limits allowed up to define what a continuous 
function is.  We saw that a function might be composed of pieces ... and still be continuous.
There are four ways to remove discontinuities.  There are five kinds of discontinuities.
The powerful language of limits extended to describe phenomena at infinities, as well as ``values'' 
of the infinities.  Ultimately, limits were used to make possible difference quotients, the 
average rate of change of a function at an instant.
