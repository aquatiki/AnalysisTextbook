\mychapter{Infinities}{infinity}


In all of calculus, one number is unique, containing an infinite exponent in a finite number.
$e$ is hard to appreciate until you start considering rates of change, 
accumulated distance, or continuous growth.  

But what does infinity even mean?  Nothing in our world has even gone on without limit,
except perhaps black holes.  Aristotle said there are two kinds of infinities: potential and
actual.  But Georg Cantor said a physical potential infinity presupposes an actual infinity
in our minds, the mental construct we are saying would come into existence, if were to 
continue.

Amazingly, all this heady talk of math and philosophy has real-life implications.  The infinite
sum of all the natural numbers appears on page 22 of Joseph Polchinski's classic, 
\textit{String Theory}.  Calculus itself --- with all its myriad applications in our lives today
--- is the based on the assumption that a line is subdivided into a infinite number of
indivisible units.  Whether or not they exist in nature, infinities are useful mathematical
constructs.

\subsection{Cumulative Review}
This unit has been a diverse whirlwind.  We united almost everything we had ever seen
before in math where $x$ had an exponent on it under the heading ``Power Function''.
Next we added such things together to get polynomials.  Then we divided those by each
other and got rational functions.  Then we swapped where $x$ was and put it in the
exponent.  This produced functions which ``transcended'' algebra, where ordinary inputs
could produce amazingly irrational answers.  The inverses of these functions were called
logs.

This transcendental leap allowed us to get a perspective on mathematics itself.  What 
are we doing here?  Are all these abstract things just in our minds?  If so, why do they 
works so well in the world?  It is surprisingly easy to imagine some things that 
seemingly do not exist: namely infinities.  Some are countable, some are not.  Such
crazy ideas were necessary to continue finding derivatives to everything kind of function
we might need in the world, but they produce some logical conundrums.   But they
are the very foundation of all the calculus we have been doing!
