\prob[AA06CubeDifference] It is rather straightforward to derive the Difference of Squares formula by re-organizing rectangles (see Fig.\~ref{fig:diffsq}).  Construct a representation (either physically or by careful drawing) or the difference of \emph{cube} and cut the leftover shape into prisms (3D rectangles).  Re-organize the prisms and find a factorization of $a^3-b^3$.
\inlinefig{\chapdir/pics/Difference_of_two_squares_geometric_proof.png}{A large square $a^2$ with a small square ($b^2$) taken out results in two rectangles, which can be rewritten as $(a+b)(a-b)$.\label{fig:diffsq}}

\prob[AA06CubeSum] By algebra manipulation, find the formula for the \emph{sum} of cubes.

\prob[AA06CS] Using $f(x) = x^2 + bx + c$, solve for $x$ by completing the square.
