\lab{} Making every box equal to 0.5, graph of $f(x)=x^{1/3}$ below.  Also graph $g(x)=x^1$.  One what intervals is the first greater than the second?\noindent
\begin{tikzpicture}[xscale=0.8,yscale=0.8]
	\draw [thick, <->] (-5.3,0) -- (5.3,0);
	\draw [thick, ->] (0,-5.3) -- (0,5.3);
	\draw [thin] (-5,-5) grid (5,5);
\end{tikzpicture}
\vspace{3cm}\lab{} On the same graph, also graph $h(x)=x^{5/3}$.  On what intervals is this greater than $g(x)$?\vspace{3cm}\lab{} When are the functions increasing and decreasing?\subprob $f(x)$\subprob $g(x)$\subprob $h(x)$
\lab{}  Record the derivative of all three functions.\vspace{4cm}\lab{}  When are the derivatives positive and negative?\subprob $f^\prime(x)$\subprob $g^\prime(x)$\subprob $h^\prime(x)$\lab{}  Find the derivatives of the derivatives, the second derivatives of each function.  Record them here.\vspace{4cm}\lab{} When are the function concave and convex?  Concave is ‘U’ shaped, while convex is hill-shaped.\subprob $f(x)$\subprob $g(x)$\subprob $h(x)$\lab{} When are the second derivatives positive and negative?\subprob $f^{\prime\prime}(x)$\subprob $g^{\prime\prime}(x)$\subprob $h^{\prime\prime}(x)$\lab{} In technical language, describe what you think the point of this problem set is.
