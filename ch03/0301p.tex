\subsection{In Pieces}
\noindent
1. There is a function called the \textbf{floor} function, written
$f(x)=\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor$.  In the TI-8*, it is called \texttt{int(},
found under MATH-NUM.  Graph the function under a standard 
window and sketch a copy below.  Describe what you
think the function does to the input in your own words.

\noindent
2.  In the function continuous?  If not, where not?  

\vspace{3cm}
\noindent
3. Select an appropriate locus and calculate the instantaneous rate of change
of the function.  Extrapolate for all Reals, and write a piecewise function
for the derivative of the floor function.

\vspace{3cm}
\noindent
4. Another common function from computer science is the \textbf{remainder}
function, typically called \texttt{mod} in most programming languages, or is just written with
a percent sign (\%).  It can be reproduced quite simply on the TI-8*.  For example,
$g(x)=x\%5$ can be entered as $Y_2=X-5int(X/5)$.  Sketch a graph below.
How would \emph{you} define the remainder function?

\noindent
5. Find $g'(2)$.  The recurrent discontinuities should be obvious.  Write
a piecewise function for the derivative of the modulus function $y=x\%n$
for any $n$.

\vspace{4cm}
\noindent
6. A linear but periodic function is hard to define.  We will construct one in
three stages, but turn off the first two.  Let $Y_1=|fpart(X/2)|$.  Let
$Y_2=remainder(iPart(|X|),2)$.  But only leave on $Y_3=2|Y_2(X)-Y_1(X)|$.
Sketch a graph below.

\noindent
7. Unlike the previous functions, this one has no discontinuities.  However,
there are an infinite number of places where the instantaneous rate of change
is incalculable.  Define all the places where the difference quotient will not
work and we cannot find the derivative.

8. What did you learn as a result of doing this exploration that you did not
know before?
