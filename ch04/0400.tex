More complicated things can happen to functions, not the least of which is that they can be nested, 
like Russian dolls.  It is also possible for the $x$ and $y$ of our graphs to be defined by some
other variable, call the parameter.  That skill-set will then unable us to see which functions can
be ``undone'', and which cannot be (or at least not perfectly).  It is also possible 
to analyze the reciprocal of a function.   We will also consider what happens 
when the input and/or output of a function is a distance, i.e. absolute value.

\section{Review}
\subsection{Chapter Review}
In this chapter we saw that the absolute value of common quantities have names and that absolute
values of known functions are reflections of certain parts of the graph only.  
A function does not have to mean $y$ is a function of $x$: they can both be a function of
another variable, usually time.  Another way to write the derivative is $\frac{dy}{dx}$.
We saw that most functions can be understood as being
made out of parts --- called composition.  The rate of change of such these ``Russian doll''
functions is ``the derivative of the outside times the derivative of the inside''.

Next we looked at the reciprocals of graphs and lastly the inverses.  With numbers, these can
be notated the same way, but with functions, there is no shortcut to writing the derivative.
An inverse is the ``undo'' of a function, the swapping of input for output.  However, not all 
functions are reversible across their entire domain.  The derivative of the inverse if the same
as the reciprocal of the derivative.

\subsection{Cumulative Review} 
This major section of the book has been about algebraic functions, that is, functions made out
of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponents (roots are exponents).  We 
can either evaluate a function at a point, or take its limit.  Functions can be manipulate
algebraically or even combined.  We can move fluidly from verbal to numeric to algebraic to
graphical, or any combination thereof.  Algebraic functions have algebraic derivatives and are
themselves derivatives of more algebraic functions.
