\objective{Calculate and graph reciprocal functions.}

Calculating the reciprocal of a function is very straightforward.  For any given $x$,
take the output $f(x)$, and then reciprocate that number.  What that leads to is a
complicated picture.  However, a pattern emerges.  The reciprocal of 1 is 1, and the
reciprocal of -1 is -1.  That means points on the graph with a $y$ of 1 will not
be effected by reciprocation.  Other integer outputs will reciprocate to smaller and
smaller fractions, e.g. 2 to $\frac{1}{2}$, 3 to $\frac{1}{3}$, etc.

What is unusual is the behavior around 0.  Zero has no reciprocal, so there will 
typically be a vertical asymptote.

Especially in trigonometry, reciprocals can have names.
