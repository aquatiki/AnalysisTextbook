\subsection{Parametric Forms}
Conic sections lend themselves incredibly well to a variety of forms.  We saw in the last 
section that the Cartesian forms used for graphing are very versatile, always showing
a center $(h,k)$, as well as some other feature(s).  These attributes are all preserved when
we switch from graphing a relation with $x$ and $y$, to a set of functions with $x$ and $y$
both in terms of $t$.  

\begin{derivation}{Parametric Equations Ellipses}
\begin{equation}
	\begin{cases}
	x = a\sin(t) + h \\
	y = b\sin(t) + k\\
	\end{cases}
	\quad \text{or} \quad
	\begin{cases}
	x = b\sin(t) + h \\
	y = a\sin(t) + k\\
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
\end{derivation}

As we saw in the Lab, these forms are completely interchangeable with the Cartesian equations,
by the Pythagorean Trigonometric Identities.  Because one is the sum of squares, and the other two
are the difference of squares, the latter are completely identical, but, as a rule, we only every use
tangent and secant.

\begin{derivation}{Parametric Equations of Hyperbolas}
\begin{equation}
	\begin{cases}
	x = a\sec(t) + h\\
	y = b\tan(t) + k\\
	\end{cases}
	\quad \text{or} \quad
	\begin{cases}
	x = b\tan{t} + h\\
	y = a\sec(t) + k\\
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
\end{derivation}

\subsection{Algebra General Form}
The unity of conics sections is deep and wide.  Not only do they have a common geometric
origin, but they also all share the same algebraic origin, as the next order of general equations
after lines.  You will recall that there is a general form of linear equations, $Ax + By + C = 0$.
The general form of quadratic equations is similar: $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F=0$.

\subsubsection{Using a Calculator}
These conic sections are not functions (having multiple outputs per input), but only just.
There are never more than two $y$ values for any $x$ input, so they can be graphed on
your TI-8* by entering two equations.  To do that, we need to solve for $y$ first.

While there are two variable present in these equations, we are only interested in one of them
at a time, so we may regard the general form as a quadratic in $y$ with difficult coefficients:

\begin{equation*}
(C)y^2 + (Bx + E)y + (Ax^2  + Dx + F) = 0
\end{equation*}

By application of the Quadratic Formula, we can produce two equations for $y$:

\begin{equation}
y = \frac{-Bx - E \pm \sqrt{(Bx + E)^2 - 4\cdot{}C(Ax^2 + Dx + F)}}{2C}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Discriminant}
The presence of a $B$ term makes a conic \emph{much} more complicated, namely by 
rotating it.  We will consider rotation in the next section, but there is a formula which
applies to conics --- no matter how complicated --- to determine their classification.
To understand where it comes from, consider that only $A$, $B$, and $C$ contribute
to the overall shape (differing from the general linear form).  If we divide
$Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 = 0$ by $x^2$, we see that it is a quadratic in $\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)$.
The number of solution to that equation dictates what shape the graph will be.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $B^2 - 4AC > 0$, then it is a hyperbola.
\item If $B^2 - 4AC = 0$, then it is a parabola.
\item If $B^2 - 4AC < 0$, then it is a eclipse.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Rotated Conics}
\subsection{Cartesian Rotation Equations}

\subsection{Parametric Rotation by Matrix}
As we saw in ยงB.1, there exists a simple linear transformation to rotate any $2\times 1$ 
matrix by angle $\theta$:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
	\cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\
	\sin\theta & \cos\theta \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

\begin{example}
\exProblem
Rotate the parametric equations $x=\sec{t}, y=\tan{t}$ by $\frac{\tau}{8}$, simplify, and convert to
Cartesian.

\exSolution
We begin with the given equations, 
$$
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix} \sec{t} \\ \tan{t} \end{bmatrix}
$$
and left-multiply by
$$
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\frac{\tau}{8} & -\sin\frac{\tau}{8} \\
\sin\frac{\tau}{8} & \cos\frac{\tau}{8} \end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \end{bmatrix}
$$
which gives us 
$$
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\sec{t} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\tan{t} \\
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\sec{t} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\tan{t}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
This requires some strategic thinking on our part.  Adding or subtracting the equations would can
a term, but not yield anything which could be further reduced.  \emph{Multiplying} them, however,
produces a difference of trigonometric squares, which is precisely the identity we are hoping to use.
This means $xy = \frac{2}{4}\sec^2{t} - \frac{2}{4}\tan^2{t}$.  By factoring out the half, we can use
the identity $\sec^2{t}-\tan^2{t}=1$, and get that $xy=\frac{1}{2}$.
\end{example}

\section{Eccentricity}
\subsection{Foci}
For simplicity's sake, let us consider conics about the origin.  The circle is clearly a special case,
``the set of all points a constant distance (the \textbf{radius}) from the center.''  As we consider how to 
build an ellipse, it can be sketched as ``the set of all points who sum of their distances from 
two points (called the \textbf{foci} --- the plural of \textbf{focus}) is a constant.''

Now, we can clearly move the foci and yet keep the long-ends of an ellipse in place.  This
suggest comparing the ratio of the distance from the center to the foci ($c$), to the distance
from the center to the longer edge ($a$).  This ratio is called the conics \textbf{eccentricity}.
For circles, it is 0.  For ellipses, it is in the range $(0,1)$.  At 1, the focus is on top of the major
axis, and the shape is a parabola.    If we push onward, we come to the weird world of
hyperbolas, where eccentricity is $>1$.  They can be defined by foci as ``the set of all points
who difference of their distances from two points (called the \textbf{foci}) is a constant.''

\subsubsection{Formulae}
So, to summarize, circle either have no foci, or else we might regard them as both being at
the center.  Ellipses have two foci, $c$ away from the center.  To find $c$, we use the
formula:
\begin{equation}
a^2 = b^2 + c^2
\end{equation}
As we saw back in ยง3.2, parabolas have but one focus, and it is $4p$ units away from the
vertex/center.  Hyperbola also have the foci inside their curves, but for them, $c$ is the
greatest length, following the formula
\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation}

\subsection{Directrices}
There is one other feature of conics we have yet to discuss, but which was mentioned back
in ยง3.2: a directrix.  You recall that we can also define a parabola as ``the set of all points
who distance from a point (the focus) and a line (the directrix) is a constant.''  Does such a line
exist for the other conics?  Indeed it does, and it can be defined by the very constant we have
already found, the eccentricity.

Every conic section may be defined as ``the set of all points who distance from a point
(a focus) equals the distance from a line (a directrix) times the eccentricity.''  This leads to
the formula for the distance from the center to the directrix/directrices ($d$) as:
\begin{equation}
d = \frac{a^2}{c}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Polar Forms}
In addition to the Cartesian and Parametric definitions of conics, there are also polar
forms.  Polar equations tend to be very neat when a particular feature (usually, but not
always the center) is at the pole, and horrific when it is not.  Polar equations of conics are
no different, and so we only use the form where a focus is at the pole.  With that constraint,
we can define the all at once as
\begin{equation}
r = \frac{ed}{1\pm e\cos\theta}
\end{equation}
and cosine could be sine.
